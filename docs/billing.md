# Billing

Billing is managed on the [Zimscape console](console.md). Billing is done per project with each project having
what we call a project account.
As such a Zimscape profile can have multiple project accounts that can be funded separately and as such 
any billing disruption only applies on a per project basis.

Things to note about billing on Zimscape:
 
- Primary currency is ZWL (Zimbabwean Dollar)
- All prices are convertible to supported currencies at prevailing exchange rates. Supported currencies
are shown on the Shopping Cart checkout page.
- The primary billing cycle is monthly. However, some products have longer or shorter cycles. For certainty
check the shopping cart checkout page or product details page. 
- Billing is considered per product not per order. This means that if an order has a domain name subscription 
paid yearly and a dev environment subscription paid monthly then the next month's payment notice will only 
include the dev environment subscription.

!!!important
    Product plans can be upgraded and downgraded at will. The caveat to this is that a new payment initiates a
    new billing cycle and any credit that remains at the point when an upgrade or downgrade occurs is added 
    to the new billing cycle at the new plan's daily charge rate.
