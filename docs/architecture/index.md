# A Deployment Platform - The PaaS Idea

Zimscape is by design a platform as a service (PaaS). What is a PaaS you say? Check out what Azure has
to say about it [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-paas/). 
The simple version is that Zimscape provides a platform that allows developers and businesses to deploy 
software as well as provision the hardware resources that they need in order to run the software. 
Zimscape was born out of the burden to solve the challenges around finding, building and deploying web software, 
provisioning compute resources to run it, and maintaining high availability throughout the
lifecycle of the software.

This effectively makes Zimscape a deployment platform. Our focus is primarily on delivering software to 
production environments in the simplest way possible. Whether that software is coming from a development
environment or has been pre-packaged for easy reuse.

## What Zimscape is not

Zimscape is not your average web hosting platform. Zimscape's approach is to leverage 
[containerization](containers.md) technology
to create an abstraction layer between software and the hardware resources needed to run it. We highlight some of
the benefits of this [here](containers.md). However, In order to achieve
this level of abstraction Zimscape insists that users follow certain conventions that otherwise wouldn't be 
imposed by an ordinary web hosting provider. Whilst there might be a learning curve to some of these we believe
that these conventions make your work flow significantly easier especially when it comes to deployment.

## Business Solutions

As a deployment platform Zimscape also endeavours to make it easier for average businesses to access technology
solutions. We leverage our knowledge in software development (Dev) and information-technology operations (Ops)
to provide easy deployment options for business tools like monitoring, reports and collaboration tools.
