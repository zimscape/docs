# Add Ons

Add ons are a convenient way for you to expand the way your application container works. By design containers
have a restricted range of features. They are streamlined to run a few processes and run them well. In the 
event that you need to expand the range of features available, for example, adding a web server for a static 
website, then you'd need to install an add on.

We are constantly adding to the list of add ons to support a wide variety of use cases.
