# Projects

Applications deployed on Zimscape are deployed under projects. In order to deploy applications on Zimscape a 
user must have created a project to house those applications under. A user can create as many projects as they
need.

### Things to note about projects on Zimscape are:

- Projects are the parent object required for deployment of any service on Zimscape
- A project's identity is derived directly from the domain name chosen for the project. A project can only 
have one domain name and that domain name sticks throughout the existence of the project affecting
application hostnames and service names
- [Billing](../billing.md) is done per project. As such a Zimscape account can have multiple project accounts 
that can be funded separately and as such any billing disruption only applies on a per project basis.
- Each project's first deployment is eligible for a free offer. A gift from us to you on your latest 
adventure &#x1F603;
