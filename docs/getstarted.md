# Getting Started

### Registration

When registering a new account on Zimscape take note that the email address required needs to be an active 
one that you have immediate access to.

### Account Details

We collect trading details for your organization for purposes of our records as well as third party 
records like registrars for domain names.

### Creating a project

A [project](architecture/projects.md) is the top level object you need to start deploying apps on 
Zimscape. Your Zimscape account can have as many projects as you need. All that's required to deploy a 
project is a valid domain name. A project deployed without any other
apps would have a single subscription, the [domain hosting](products/domains.md) subscription.

### Products

Zimscape refers to all available applications whether prepackaged or development environments as product.
Essentially, anything that can be deployed from the products page is a product. Once deployed products become
subscriptions and respective billing information can be viewed on the billing page.

Products are added to a project. A project can have many products but can only have one type of each product, 
never more than one i.e. you can only deploy one PHP subscription in a project. Once a subscription is 
deployed, any subsequent deployment will be handled according to our [Billing Policy](billing.md).

### Billing

Each project's first deployment is eligible for a free offer. This means that the first deployment is always
free. In addition, each new project gets free credit upon first deployment, because who doesn't love a freebie... 
The amount of credit varies but is usually enough for an average deployment for a database driven application.
